# CORS Issue Resolution - Status Update

## ‚úÖ PROBLEM SOLVED: CORS Error Fixed

**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Issue:** "Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource"

### üîß What Was Fixed

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error was preventing the frontend (http://localhost:5173) from communicating with the backend API (http://localhost:8000). This was blocking the login functionality and all API calls.

### üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made

1. **Enhanced CORS Configuration in `simple-api.php`:**
   - Added dedicated `setCorsHeaders()` function
   - Improved OPTIONS preflight request handling
   - Added comprehensive CORS headers:
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:5173`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Accept, Authorization, X-Requested-With`
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
     - `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`

2. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Added error reporting for debugging
   - Better preflight request processing
   - Proper header sequencing

3. **Created Testing Scripts:**
   - `start-app-with-cors-test.ps1` - Comprehensive startup with CORS testing
   - `quick-start.ps1` - Quick server start with CORS verification
   - Updated `start-app.ps1` - Simple startup script

### üöÄ How to Start the Application

**Option 1: Simple Start (Recommended)**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\PhpstormProjects\SI
.\start-app.ps1
```

**Option 2: Quick Start with CORS Test**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\PhpstormProjects\SI
.\quick-start.ps1
```

**Option 3: Comprehensive Testing**
```powershell
cd c:\Users\user\PhpstormProjects\SI
.\start-app-with-cors-test.ps1
```

### üß™ Test Credentials

Login with any of these test credentials:

| Email | Password | Role |
|-------|----------|------|
| demo@demo.com | demo123 | Demo User |
| admin@vehiclemanagement.com | password123 | Admin |
| manager@vehiclemanagement.com | password123 | Manager |
| test@example.com | password | Test User |

### üåê Application URLs

- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000/simple-api.php
- **Test Login API:** http://localhost:8000/simple-api.php/api/auth/login

### ‚úÖ Expected Behavior Now

1. **Login Page:** Should load without errors
2. **Login Form:** Should accept credentials and login successfully
3. **API Calls:** All vehicle management API calls should work
4. **Navigation:** Should redirect to dashboard after successful login

### üîç Verification Steps

1. Start the application using any of the startup scripts
2. Navigate to http://localhost:5173
3. Try logging in with test credentials
4. Verify you're redirected to the dashboard
5. Test vehicle management features (view, add, edit, delete)

### üìÅ Key Files Modified

- `simple-api.php` - Enhanced with robust CORS handling
- `start-app.ps1` - Updated with CORS fix notification
- `start-app-with-cors-test.ps1` - New comprehensive testing script
- `quick-start.ps1` - New quick verification script

### üéØ Next Steps

With the CORS issue resolved, you can now:

1. **Test the complete application** - All Phase 1 & 2 features should work
2. **Continue to Phase 3** - Maintenance System Implementation
3. **Begin Phase 4** - Advanced features (fuel tracking, reporting)

### üêõ If Issues Persist

If you still encounter CORS errors:

1. Ensure both servers are running on the correct ports
2. Check that no other applications are using ports 8000 or 5173
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try the comprehensive testing script to see detailed CORS headers

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Ready for:** Full application testing and Phase 3 development
